# Security Measures:
# Password Hashing: 
User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before storing them in the database. This protects against password leaks and unauthorized access to user accounts.
# JWT Authentication: 
JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication, providing a stateless and scalable solution. Tokens are signed with a secret key and have a short expiration time to limit their validity.

#Challenges
Database Integration: Integrating a SQL database (PostgreSQL in this case) was quite challenging for me
